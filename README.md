# FoundationApplication
This repository contains all my practice code based on the C# tutorials from W3Schools. It includes examples for variables, data types, operators, conditionals, loops, methods, arrays, classes, switch statements, and more. The goal is to build a strong foundation in C# programming by working through hands-on examples step by step.
